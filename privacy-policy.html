                    <h2>Duration and Study System of Medicine in Germany</h2>

                    <p>
                      Although studying medicine in English is still limited,
                      the program duration is the same as German-taught
                      programs. Medical studies in Germany last approximately 6
                      years and 3 months and are divided into three stages:
                      pre-clinical studies (2 years), clinical studies (3
                      years), and a final practical year with intensive hospital
                      training.

                    <h2>Costs of Studying Medicine in Germany in English</h2>

                    <p>
                      Tuition fees vary depending on the university and program.
                      English-taught medical programs are usually offered by
                      private universities, with fees ranging from 100 to 500
                      euros per semester. For detailed cost information and
                      payment methods, students can contact EGEC advisors
                      directly.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Yes, some institutions such as medical universities

                      programs in English, following international standards.

                      medicine legally in Germany, after meeting equivalency and
