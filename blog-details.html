                        taught in English to meet the needs of international
                        students, especially those who wish to pursue medical

                        programs provide comprehensive education that combines

                        research, and modern medical practices. Studying in
                        English also allows students to gradually integrate into
                        German culture and communicate within a diverse
                        international medical community.

                      <h2>Duration and Study System of Medicine in Germany</h2>

                      <p>
                        Although studying medicine in English is still limited,
                        the program duration is the same as German-taught
                        programs. Medical studies in Germany last approximately
                        6 years and 3 months and are divided into three stages:
                        pre-clinical studies (2 years), clinical studies (3
                        years), and a final practical year with intensive
                        hospital training.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Costs of Studying Medicine in Germany in English</h2>

                      <p>
                        Tuition fees vary depending on the university and
                        program. English-taught medical programs are usually
                        offered by private universities, with fees ranging from
                        100 to 500 euros per semester. For detailed cost
                        information and payment methods, students can contact
                        EGEC advisors directly.

                      <p>
                        Yes, some institutions such as medical universities
